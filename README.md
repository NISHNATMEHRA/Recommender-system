# Recommender-system
The TMDB Movie Recommender System leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques along with preprocessing, cleaning, and CountVectorizer to recommend movies to users based on textual features extracted from movie metadata. It combines content-based filtering with vectorization of textual data to provide personalized movie recommendations tailored to individual user preferences.

# Key Features:

# Textual Feature Extraction
 The system extracts textual features from movie metadata, including titles, overviews, genres, and keywords. It preprocesses and cleans the text data to remove noise, punctuation, and stop words, ensuring high-quality feature representation.

# Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
Using NLP techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and stemming, the system transforms raw text data into structured numerical representations suitable for analysis and modeling. It captures semantic similarities and relationships between movies based on their textual descriptions.

# CountVectorizer 
The system utilizes CountVectorizer, a text vectorization technique, to convert textual data into numerical feature vectors. It builds a vocabulary of words present in the movie metadata and represents each movie as a vector of word counts, capturing the frequency of occurrence of each word.

# Content-Based Filtering 
Leveraging the vectorized textual features, the system performs content-based filtering to recommend movies similar to those the user has previously interacted with or expressed interest in. It identifies movies with similar textual descriptions and genres, enhancing the relevance and accuracy of recommendations.

# Personalized Recommendations 
By analyzing the textual features of movies and considering user preferences, the system generates personalized movie recommendations tailored to individual user tastes and viewing habits. It suggests movies that align with the user's interests and preferences, enhancing the movie discovery experience.
